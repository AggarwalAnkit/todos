# todos

A simple todo app to add, delete and edit todo. Its implemented with firebase. So all notes are stored on firebase.

1. Master brach has latest code
2. navigator_implementation branch uses default react navigator to navigate between home screen and create/edit screen.
3. modal_implementation branch implements create note functionality using modal. It doesn't have any navigator related code and was an initial experiment.
